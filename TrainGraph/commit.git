Error Correcting . . . Station less than zero

Modified:
1	showTrainSched(TRAINS trainList[100], string stationList[], TRAINS shortMatrix[100][100], int middleMatrix[100][100])


Reason:
1	Needed to take into account if the user inputed a negative number.  Forgot to bring in the stationOrder array into the findTrain function, lost half of my points because of this ;(
